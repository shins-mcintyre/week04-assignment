Put reflections here

Reflection
Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

This was my process:

1. Followed set-up steps to set up client/server folders as we have done before. checked that the root routes were working on localhost
2. Created an empty database table in Supabase with the columns I needed
3. Set up the connection between the database and the server through .env and dbConnection.js
<!-- - what I don;t know here is how do you check this connected ok? -->
4. Added HTML to create a very basic form to start with + submit button - opened this on localhost and it comes up, but I had an error in the Console: client/app.js:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) - my app.js left out the ./src - fixed
<!-- Now I have a basic form, a server, and an empty database table, and the srever and database are linked -->
5. Now everything seems like it is set up, I will deploy with render - followed all steps but got an error in the server deployment... (==> Exited with status 1)
6. Next I am adding logic to app.js in client to collect data inputted into forms. I was getting cors error so tried adding cors to app.js but that also caused errors - found out you are not supposed to use that on client side/frontend. Realised it migt have been I didn;t have app.use(cors()) - that worked and now the event handler works!
   <!-- Now the deployment in render is working, no errors woo (idk why) -->
   <!--! THIS IS WHAT I NEED TO FIGURE OUT - TRY code from fox site? -->
7. Next steps in app.js - render the user data on the interface
8. I need to somehow make it so the data that is submitted on the form is going into the database - done!! And after a long time of fixing error after error I also managed to get this working with the render link and not just local host - this was super hard

Requirements
🎯 Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.

<!-- I need to workout why the data is not going into my data base - I figured it out!! Using code from demo yesterday woo-->

🎯 Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either Responsive Design or media queries.

<!-- Do CSS and make it responsive -->

🎯 Create a working GET API route in your server.

<!-- I believe this is all good because the message of my GET route appears when I open the page - however maybe I need to change what the route actually does rather than just send a message? It should be the one that is used to render the data on the interface... but I think I only add that logic when I fetch it in app.js so perhaps it's ok as is -->

🎯 Create a working POST API route in your client.

<!-- I have also done this - the message of the route appears in my server terminal when I click submit on the form. Do I need to add the action within here to put the data that is submitted into the database? -->

🎯 Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.

<!--I managed to do this following demo steps. However I was getting the same issue with the workshop where multiple of the same rows of data were showing (even though I ran 'node seed.js' in the terminal, and not --watch. I searched how to control that and added a suggestion from chatGPT to only allow unique entries. I also then wanted to add data from SQL but was having issue with the date format, which is different in SQL than VScode - I searched how to control the date format so they are the same. The solution was more complicated than expected so I just changed the way I typed the dates to match SQL YYYY/MM/DD -->

Stretch goals
🏹 Provide additional functionality on the form, for example, by adding form validation or other options.

<!-- add form validations - not too hard -->

🏹 Style the page excellently, for example, by adding extra UX considerations or animations.

<!-- refresh on ux recommendations for forms -->

🏹 Add a delete button to each message and a DELETE route in the server.
🏹 Create an option for users to like others’ posts.

<!-- design the page so each time a form is submitted, a card appears on the page with the information they submitted -->

Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Optional
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
What went really well and what could have gone better?

Tips:

- The bigger picture is scary and overhwelming - divide your project into small manageable steps - use user stories to help
- Deploy as soon as possible
- Plan Plan PLAN! - keeps you focused
